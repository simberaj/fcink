# FCINK - a Tkinter-based function graph plotter

Fcink is a simple program that creates 2D graphs of mathematical functions.

Requires Python 3 (with Tkinter), no other dependencies.
The functions are limited to the contents of Python's `math` module and a 
single input argument. Other arguments may be included as parameters.

Useful for maths teaching or simple look-and-see analysis.

## Features
* Axis scaling and moving, automatic axis centering/cornering
* Pi-based x-scale
* Multiple functions, changing colour
* Saving and loading plots
* Detection of single-point undefined values such as in `tg(x)`
* Interface so far only in Czech but can be modified by overwriting the config files.

## Development
Active development ceased, will only be continued upon request.
